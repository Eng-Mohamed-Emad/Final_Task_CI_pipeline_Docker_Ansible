# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built using **Flask**, **SQLite**, and the **OpenWeatherMap API**. The app allows users to search for the weather of a specific city, view past searches, and remove cities from the database.

## Features

- **City Search**: Search weather for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Cached Weather Data**: Caches weather data in an SQLite database to minimize API calls.
- **Last Searched City**: Saves the last searched city and displays it when you return to the homepage.
- **City Management**: You can delete cities from the weather history.
